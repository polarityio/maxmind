# Polarity MaxMind Integration

The Polarity [Maxmind](https://www.maxmind.com/) integration allows Polarity to retrieve geolocation information for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using the MaxMind GeoIP2 or GeoLite2 databases.  

You can download the free MaxMind GeoLite2 City and ASN databases directly from MaxMind at [https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)

You will need to download both the `GeoLite2 City` database (in binary format) and the `GeoLite2 ASN` database (also in binary format).  Both of these database should be uploaded to your Polarity Server or a file path accessible to your Polarity Server.
 
## Installation Instructions

Installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).
